# How to run the app

1) To run tests independently of the application, simply navigate to this directory via a terminal or command line and run **"./build-test.sh"** on Mac/Unix and **"sh build-test.sh"** on Windows/in PowerShell
2) To run the entire application, navigate to this directory and run **"./start.sh"** or **"sh start.sh"**, similar to the instructions above.

That's it! Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my submission.
